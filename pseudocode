2. user_step_point table:

Assumptions: I believe this table is a relational DB, which will link to multiple tables such as user main table, and this is used to track earned points transactions
Fields: user_step_point_id (PK),
        transaction_id uniqueidentifier,
        user_id (FK),
        steps bigint,
        step_date datetime,
        created_on datetime,
        created_by uniqueidentifier,
        modified_on datetime,
        modified_by uniqueidentifier,
        is_deleted bit
        
        Create index for this table as well, to increate the DB performance (depends on the field been sued for query)
          - e.g. user_id field
          
          
3. Assumed that this project is build in multi-tier architecture, and
